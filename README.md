# AMD-Catalyst for Windows 10/11
Driver Updates for AMD Radeon™ Series Graphics and Ryzen™ Chipsets.\
This repository is not official, but it provides the official drivers extracted directly from the [AMD Drivers and Support](https://www.amd.com/en/support) website.
# Fully Automated Repo
This repository is fully automated, it checks and updates the drivers folder daily if necessary.\
Unfortunately it's based on web scraping and could end up broken if AMD's frontend changes, I'll try to support it until there's a better alternative.
